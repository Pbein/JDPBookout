JDPowerDownloader Debug Version

This is a debug version that shows console output to help identify issues.

HOW TO USE:
1. Double-click "Launch_Debug.bat" to start the debug version
2. Watch the console output to see what's happening
3. The GUI will still appear, but you'll also see error messages in the console

This version helps identify why the application might be completing immediately
without processing any downloads.

For support, share the console output with the developer.
