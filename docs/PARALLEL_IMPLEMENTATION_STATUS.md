# Parallel Processing Implementation Status

**Branch:** `automation-parallel-2`  
**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components have been implemented following the directive in `docs/PARALLEL_PROCESSING_DIRECTIVE.md`.

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] `jdp_scraper/async_utils.py` - AsyncSemaphorePool for concurrency control
- [x] `jdp_scraper/context_pool.py` - Browser context pooling with resource blocking
- [x] `jdp_scraper/checkpoint.py` - Thread-safe with asyncio.Lock

### Async Modules ✅
- [x] `jdp_scraper/auth_async.py` - Async login
- [x] `jdp_scraper/license_page_async.py` - Async license acceptance
- [x] `jdp_scraper/inventory_async.py` - Async inventory operations
- [x] `jdp_scraper/vehicle_async.py` - Async PDF download

### Orchestration ✅
- [x] `jdp_scraper/orchestration_async.py` - Main orchestrator with pre-assignment strategy
- [x] `main_async.py` - Entry point with blocking execution

### Testing ✅
- [x] `test_parallel_10.py` - Test script for 10 vehicles, 2 contexts

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Pre-Assignment Strategy**
Vehicles are pre-assigned to contexts before processing starts, preventing duplicate downloads:
```python
# Each context gets a specific list of vehicles
assignments = {
    0: [ref1, ref3, ref5, ...],  # Context 0's vehicles
    1: [ref2, ref4, ref6, ...],  # Context 1's vehicles
}
```

### 2. **Blocking Execution**
Script uses `asyncio.run()` which blocks until all work is complete:
```python
def main():
    asyncio.run(run_async())  # Blocks here
```

### 3. **Thread-Safe Operations**
All shared resources use `asyncio.Lock`:
- Checkpoint updates
- Metrics recording
- Semaphore pool statistics

### 4. **Resource Blocking**
Contexts block unnecessary resources for 30-50% speedup:
- Images
- Stylesheets
- Fonts
- Media

### 5. **Error Recovery**
Multi-level error handling:
- Per-vehicle retries (2 attempts)
- Recovery to inventory page
- Stuck tab cleanup
- Graceful degradation

### 6. **ASCII-Only Output**
All console output uses ASCII characters only (no Unicode/emojis) to prevent Windows encoding errors.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Test with 10 vehicles, 2 contexts:
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python test_parallel_10.py
```

### Production with custom settings:
```bash
# Set environment variables in .env:
MAX_DOWNLOADS=2000
CONCURRENT_CONTEXTS=5
HEADLESS=true

# Run:
.\.venv\Scripts\python main_async.py
```

## 📊 Expected Performance

| Configuration | Time per Vehicle | Total Time (2000) | Speedup |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Sequential (main) | 60s | 33h | 1x |
| 2 contexts | 30s | 16.5h | 2x |
| 3 contexts | 20s | 11h | 3x |
| 5 contexts | 15s | 8h | 4x |

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before running the test:

- [ ] Virtual environment activated: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
- [ ] Dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Playwright browsers installed: `playwright install chromium`
- [ ] `.env` file configured with credentials
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (2GB+ for 2000 PDFs)
- [ ] Stable internet connection

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Validation ✅ READY
- **Test:** 10 vehicles, 2 contexts, non-headless
- **Script:** `test_parallel_10.py`
- **Goal:** Verify basic functionality, no crashes
- **Expected Time:** ~5 minutes

### Phase 2: Expanded Testing (Next)
- **Test:** 30 vehicles, 3 contexts, headless
- **Goal:** Validate parallel efficiency, error handling
- **Expected Time:** ~10 minutes

### Phase 3: Stress Testing (Later)
- **Test:** 100 vehicles, 5 contexts, headless
- **Goal:** Validate stability for extended runs
- **Expected Time:** ~30 minutes

### Phase 4: Production Run (Final)
- **Test:** 2000 vehicles, 5 contexts, headless
- **Goal:** Full inventory download
- **Expected Time:** ~8 hours

## 📝 What to Watch During Testing

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ All contexts initialize successfully
- ✅ Vehicles are processed in parallel (2+ at once)
- ✅ No duplicate downloads
- ✅ PDFs saved with correct names
- ✅ Tracking.json updated correctly
- ✅ Script blocks until complete (doesn't exit early)
- ✅ Final report shows accurate metrics

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ Contexts failing to initialize
- ⚠️ Same vehicle processed multiple times
- ⚠️ Script exits before completion
- ⚠️ Unicode encoding errors
- ⚠️ Browser crashes
- ⚠️ Memory usage > 1GB

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **requests library is sync** - The actual PDF download uses sync `requests.get()` for simplicity. This is acceptable as downloads are fast (~1-2s).

2. **No dynamic context scaling** - Number of contexts is fixed at startup. Future enhancement could add dynamic scaling based on performance.

3. **No progress bar** - Console output is text-based. Future enhancement could add a visual progress indicator.
