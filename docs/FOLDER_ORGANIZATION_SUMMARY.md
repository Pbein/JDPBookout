# Folder Organization Feature - Summary

## Overview

Implemented clean subfolder structure to organize downloads better, separating PDFs from run data files.

## New Structure

```
downloads/MM-DD-YYYY/
  ├── pdfs/          (all vehicle PDFs)
  │   ├── 165549.pdf
  │   ├── 165614.pdf
  │   └── ...
  └── run_data/      (CSV, JSON, metrics, checkpoint)
      ├── inventory.csv
      ├── tracking.json
      ├── checkpoint.json
      ├── metrics.json
      └── validation_report.json
```

## Old Structure (Legacy)

```
downloads/MM-DD-YYYY/
  ├── 165549.pdf         (mixed together)
  ├── 165614.pdf
  ├── inventory.csv
  ├── tracking.json
  ├── checkpoint.json
  └── metrics.json
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Organization**
   - PDFs separated from data files
   - Easier to navigate and find files
   - Professional folder structure

2. **Better File Management**
   - Easy to bulk operate on PDFs (e.g., zip all PDFs)
   - Easy to backup just the data files
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Backward Compatible**
   - Validation scripts work with both old and new structure
   - Automatically detects which structure is being used
   - No breaking changes to existing workflows

## Implementation Details

### Updated Files

1. **`jdp_scraper/config.py`**
   - Changed `DATA_DIR` to `RUN_DIR/run_data`
   - Changed `PDF_DIR` to `RUN_DIR/pdfs`
   - Added automatic folder creation with `os.makedirs()`
   - Updated `get_run_directory()` to check both structures

2. **`validate_pdfs.py`**
   - Auto-detects folder structure
   - Looks for PDFs in `pdfs/` subfolder or root
   - Looks for `tracking.json` in `run_data/` subfolder or root

3. **`validate_and_fix_pdfs.py`**
   - Same auto-detection as `validate_pdfs.py`
   - Supports both structures seamlessly

### How It Works

The system checks for the new structure first:
```python
if os.path.exists(pdf_dir) and os.path.exists(data_dir):
    # Use new structure
    pdf_folder = pdf_dir
    tracking_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "tracking.json")
else:
    # Use legacy flat structure
    pdf_folder = download_folder
    tracking_path = os.path.join(download_folder, "tracking.json")
```

## Testing

Verified with `test_folder_structure.py`:
- ✅ Folders created correctly
- ✅ Paths resolve to correct subfolders
- ✅ All files save to correct locations
- ✅ Validation scripts work with new structure

## Migration

**No manual migration required!**

- Old runs: Continue to work with legacy structure
- New runs: Automatically use new structure
- Validation scripts: Work with both

## Usage

### For Downloaders
No changes needed - the system automatically creates the right folders!

### For Validation
```bash
# Works with both old and new structure
python validate_pdfs.py "downloads/10-06-2025"
```

The script will detect and report which structure it's using:
```
[INFO] Using new organized folder structure (pdfs/ and run_data/)
```
or
```
[INFO] Using legacy flat folder structure
```

## Status

- ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Tested
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Ready for merge

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual run (download a few PDFs)
2. Verify validation works correctly
3. Merge to `main` if everything works as expected
